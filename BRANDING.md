## Aesthetic
Swiss Modernist. Minimalist Bauhaus. Our logo is 3 yellow ones witha thick black broder staggered to form an "M" in the 8 bit style, where the ones look like meerkats, which is the source of out name mkat for short. Therefore we value super bold thick and crisp modernist style lines. restrained yet impactful. Think **Notion** and **Browser Company of New York**.
